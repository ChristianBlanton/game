Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.

The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

CLOSE ON ARTHUR (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so
hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black
hair hanging down over his forehead. He's wearing an old,
faded green cardigan sweater, a threadbare gray scarf, thin
from years of use, hangs loosely around his neck._
He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),
African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a
cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high
in front of her._
She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit
to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.
Arthur takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.
Beat._
ARTHUR
--is it just me, or is it getting
crazier out there?
Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.
Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days._
SOCIAL WORKER
It's certainly tense. People are
upset, they're struggling. Looking
for work. The garbage strike seems
like it's been going on forever.
These are tough times.
(then)
How 'bout you. Have you been
keeping up with your journal?_
ARTHUR
Everyday._
SOCIAL WORKER
Great. Did you bring it with you?
Beat._
ARTHUR
(dodging the subject)
I'm sorry. Did I bring what?_
SOCIAL WORKER
(impatient; she doesn't
have time for this)
Arthur, last time I asked you to
bring your journal with you. For
these appointments. Do you have it?_
ARTHUR
Yes ma'am.
Beat._
SOCIAL WORKER
Can I see it?
He reluctantly reaches into the pocket of his jacket hanging
on the chair behind him. Pulls out a weathered notebook.
Slides it across to her--
